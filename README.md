🏎️ Autonomous ATV PCB Designs – SAE India eBaja (DJS Kronos)

Welcome to my repository of PCB designs that I created for the systems of our Autonomous ATV vehicle for the SAE India eBaja competition 🚀. As part of Team DJS Kronos, I worked on designing and developing production-ready PCBs that powered our drive-by-wire systems:

⚙️ SBW (Steer-By-Wire)

🛑 BBW (Brake-By-Wire)

⚡ TVW (Throttle-By-Wire)

🔧 PCB Highlights

✅ One-layer PCB design – optimized for cost & manufacturability

✅ Designed in KiCad 🖥️

✅ Integrated Arduino Mega & ESP32 for control and communication

✅ Onboard Buck Converter for stable power supply ⚡

✅ Proper routing, sizing, and component placement considered for industry-level manufacturing standards 🏭

🏁 Why This Matters

Building an autonomous ATV isn’t just about the mechanical design – the electronics backbone is just as important. These PCBs ensured:

🔹 Reliable communication between control units

🔹 Safe and precise steering, braking, and throttle control

🔹 Robust power regulation even under tough terrain and load conditions

💡 Learning & Impact

This project gave me end-to-end experience in PCB design, from schematics → layout → manufacturable design. It was an exciting challenge to bring core automotive systems into an autonomous format, while balancing performance, reliability, and manufacturability.
